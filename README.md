DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT0

Title: Hello World.

I wanted to make a project related to something I like, but mostly to be a first excersice of a mayer project I have and one of teh reason I'm making this class. So it is avout cars, but in order to limit the extensive world of cars, I just made a web page abuout the cars I have had, and I made a small review on them with a qualitative criteria.

I realise that is very important as a first step, to make a visual model of the page and the information, in order to better plan the code and the resources you are going to use. In my case I used a simple PowerPoint to design the layout and write all the text.

The index page, just presents the cars and link it to four other pages that works as templates, going into de description of the car.

I limit the width of the page to a 70% becaus I did not want the page to be extensive to the entire screen. Also thanks to sass I could play and decide the back color and width I wanted. I also added some Bootstrap resources that I found nice, like the back shadows and the home boton. As a mobile-responsive query, I just defined that when the width is too narrow (class="d-none d-sm-block"), the long describing text desables through a Bootstarp #class.

I do realise that there are some redundant code, and is not clean, nither eficcient, I will keep working on that in further projects.
