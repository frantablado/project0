        This was my first “0 km” as we call it in Argentina, what it means my first car fresh out of the assembly line. I loved this car, it was above all, a simple car. It was in many ways better than the Atos, but it did have me some troubles. Also it was not a safe car, specially for the road. Still, it took me to many far places with certain comfort.
