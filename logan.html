        Hyundai Atos GLS 2000

      <div id="presentation">
        Loved this car for so many reasons. Leaving in a big city, having a car with this characteristics was in many ways convenient. It wasn’t only good for every day commute, I got to travel a lot with it also. It had a 1.0 litters engine witch made it very cost efficient no matter where you go. Not so cheap to maintain, had a couple of parts not so cheap, but I had never have a problem with it mechanics. It probe to be a very robust car many times.

          <th>Security</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Not it strength.</span> In terms of active security was average for it’s time. Had ABS breaks, but NO airbag. It does not reaches to high speeds (my top speed with it was 150 km). It does have great visibility and is very stable.
The good part is that living in Argentina this is a car nobody stills. You can just park it for a day in a bad neighbor and it will be there when you were back.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Maintenance</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Almost non.</span> I bought it with 70,000 km. It former owner was a lady that never even changed the engine oil (not for 70,000km!!!). Still the car worked perfectly once we gave it it’s first service. The mechanical service was not particularly cheap (Battery, filters, oil, breaks, timing belt, etc.) for a small car, but far from expensive.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Reliability</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Never a problem.</span> Doing the mechanical service every 10,000 km the car never, ever, had a mechanical problem. There was once a problem with the horn, but that was my fault… just don’t honk it to hard. The other time was  a time I left on the fog lights, and run out of battery.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Agility</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Good for the city.</span> It does not have a quick response from dead but at high RPM you get a very dynamic car for the city. It was just great in traffic.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Comfort</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Enough for every commute.</span> With a descent radio and AC (with the AC on, engine loses a great amount of power). Not very good for long trips, seats wasn’t the most confortable. 4 people can travel very well, because the back seat has good space.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Practicality</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Gigger than it looks.</span> The trunk wasn’t large, but enough, and by putting the back seats down, I got all the space I need it to move big things like washing machines or two bicycles. Vary easy to park thanks to it’s dimensions and steering.</td>
