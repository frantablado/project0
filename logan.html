      <div id="presentation">
        So, in 2015 I started to travel a lot for work. It was mostle highway and residential streets, but still, almost half of the day I was going from one place to the other. So comfort started to be important, as well as security. Did not have much mony but the Renault Logan 2 was a very good price if I buy it cash out of the deeler. Best cost/benefit ratio ever.

It is very stable but it dose feel quite vibrant when passing the 130 km/h. It has three stars by the LatinCap and by having disc brake, plus the abs has a great answer when brake dry. Itâ€™s a modest car, with certain level of  anti-theft devices.</div></td>

The 60.000 km service was a little pricy, but I sold it before I have to make it. Changing lamps, or a tire (witch I did several times in this car) was ferly easy too.</div></td>

With a media and navigation screen, parking sensors, cup holders!, climate control, better driving position, better seats, fearly spacious. Far from being a luxurious car, was more than enough for me. A great space for four people ride, and no problem with 3 traveler in the back ether.</div></td>
