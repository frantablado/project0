      <div id="presentation">
        In 2018 I got a new job where I have to travel a lot. This time I have to hit the road almost every week for journeys that may be as long ad 3000 km. I thought of a diesel, but there are very few new Diesel cars in Argentina and most of them were big trucks. The Golf has been a car I’ve always wanted to own because of it’s practicality, low consume, high security standards and performance. It has it all… except it did came with some issues. Well, I did bought it second handed.

        <tr>
          <th>Security</th>
          <td><span id="bold">I would say as secure as I can get.</span> It does have a five starts rate by Latin NCAP, and It is very secure. Not only for me, also for my new born daughter. It is in many ways very secure, until you remember I live in Argentina, here this is not a low profile car and YES, people try to steal it already.

        <tr>
          <th>Maintenance</th>
          <td><span id="bold">It’s fordable.</span>  It does have some details that make it a little more expensive than the standard, but its ok. Very low consumption for a gasoline car.

          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Reliability</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Well… I bought it second handed.</span> That being said, I have a couple of problems that I should not have (It has 50,000 km). First, the solar roof has a lick, I took it to the dealer to fixit and it is still a problem when it rains to much for to long. Also, I had to change the Shift box. Not cheap at all. Being a automatic car I don’t understand how that could happened with only 50 thousand km. Last but not least. The battery died one morning, no notice given. I would expected a warning before it happened.

        <tr>
          <th>Agility</th>
          <td><span id="bold">It is a fun drive.</span> It is what I love most of this car. It is fast, responsive, very secure to drive and agile in traffic. Also a great car for the road. </td>

        <tr>
          <th>Comfort</th>

          <th>Practicality</th>
          <td><span id="bold">Perfect dynamic balance.</span> Great for the city, awesome in the road. I have been in the country with no problems, I have travel with 4 people for 1000 km with total comfort. I would not push it to much, bit it is a very versatile car.</td>
