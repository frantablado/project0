      <div id="presentation">
        In 2018 I got a new job where I have to travel a lot. This time I have to hit the road almost every week for journeys that may be as long ad 3000 km. I thought of a diesel, but there are very few new Diesel cars in Argentina and most of them were big trucks. The Golf has been a car I’ve always wanted to own because of it’s practicality, low consume, high security standards and performance. It has it all… except it did came with some issues. Well, I did bought it second handed.
